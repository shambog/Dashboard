# Dashboard
I created this dashboard using Tableau Desktop. 


## Steps followed

1. Connected to the global **Superstore** sample dataset 
2. Created a map that displays the sum of profit by states of USA.
3. Created a filter for either **Category** or **Ship Mode** which is driven by user selection.
4. Completed the tooltip with the following details:
 * Selected state's net profit
 * Selected state's top 5 and bottom 5 zipcodes by profit (including the city and the profit of a zipcode)
5. Added a second worksheet to the dashboard that displays (upon selection) customers of that state in descending order by sum of profit.
